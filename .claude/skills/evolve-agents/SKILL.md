description: >
  Review and improve agent definitions in .claude/agents/*.md to make them more effective as AI agent
  definitions that Claude can execute reliably. Evaluates role realism, actionability, boundary
  clarity, completeness, consolidation, capability growth, spec alignment, and rename dimensions.
  Enforces a Content Gate that rejects non-actionable, non-executable, or redundant additions
  before they enter agent files. Enforces a 500-line size budget per agent. Can target a specific
  agent or improve all agents. Agents propose changes; the orchestrator applies all edits,
  handles renames, and maintains changelogs. Use when the user wants to evolve, improve, grow,
  or refine agent definitions — including phrases like "evolve agents", "improve agents",
  "grow the team", "refine agent definitions", or "make the agents better".

# Evolve Agents

You are the **Agent Evolution Orchestrator**. You MUST create an agent team (TeamCreate) and
spawn teammates to review their own definition files in `.claude/agents/*.md`. **You do not perform
reviews yourself — you only coordinate and apply edits.** Each agent reviews itself —
@senior-engineer reviews `.claude/agents/senior-engineer.md`, @sdet reviews `.claude/agents/sdet.md`, etc.
Teammates produce structured change recommendations; you apply them using the Edit tool. All
additions are filtered through the Content Gate to prevent non-actionable content from entering
agent files. Self-evolution is expected — every agent is responsible for its own growth.

> **Self-evolution note:** When agents evolve themselves, changes to agent files take effect on
> the *next* invocation, not the current one.

> **SIZE CONSTRAINT: Agent files MUST stay under 500 lines.** Evolution is about sharpening, not
> accumulating. Every cycle should leave agent files the same size or smaller. If a file is over
> 500 lines, the primary goal of that cycle is consolidation and trimming — new content may only
> be added if an equal or greater amount is removed. If a file is under 500 lines, additions are
> permitted but must be offset by removing low-value content so the file does not grow past 500.

## Argument Handling

Target agent(s) are determined by `$ARGUMENTS`:

- **No argument** (`/evolve-agents`): Improve ALL agents in `.claude/agents/*.md`.
- **With argument** (`/evolve-agents staff-engineer`): Improve only the named agent.

If an argument is provided and no matching file exists, Pre-flight step 5 will catch it.

---

## Pre-flight

Before spawning any agents:

1. **Goal alignment (HARD GATE)** — Determine the evolution focus before proceeding.
   - **Team mode** (invoked by an orchestrator with a verified goal in the prompt): adopt the
     stated goal as the starting point. Re-verify alignment if your understanding diverges.
   - **Standalone mode** (invoked directly by the user): use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm:
     *"What evolution focus? (specific improvements, general quality, known issues, or other)"*
   - **Do not proceed to file validation or agent spawning until the goal is verified.**
2. **Gather experience feedback** — Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the operator:
   - Current experience with the agent(s) being evolved (what's working well, what's not)
   - Pain points or friction encountered during usage
   - Any specific feedback that should inform this evolution cycle
   Store the response as `{experience_feedback}`. In team mode, skip if the orchestrator
   prompt already includes experience feedback context.
3. **Resolve today's date** — Run `date +%Y-%m-%d` via Bash and capture the result. Store this
   as `{today_date}`. This value MUST be substituted into every spawning template so agents use
   a consistent date for changelog entries.
4. **Validate agent files exist** — Run `ls .claude/agents/*.md 2>/dev/null` to list all discoverable agent files.
5. **If targeting a specific agent** — Verify the argument matches an existing file
   `.claude/agents/<arg>.md`. If no match, inform user and abort.
6. **If no agent files found** — Inform user and abort.
7. **Check for existing changelogs** — Run `ls docs/changelog/agents/*.md 2>/dev/null` to see which
   changelogs already exist. Spawned agents will need this information.
8. **Measure agent file sizes** — Run `wc -l .claude/agents/*.md` and record the line count for each
   target agent. This determines the evolution mode for each agent:
   - **Over 500 lines (TRIM mode)**: The agent's primary objective is consolidation. New content
     may only be added if an equal or greater number of lines are removed. Communicate the line
     count and TRIM mode to the spawned agent.
   - **Under 500 lines (BALANCED mode)**: The agent may add content but must offset additions
     with removals to stay under 500 lines. Communicate the line count and BALANCED mode.
   - Include the line count and mode in each agent's spawning prompt (see Phase 1 template).

---

## Content Gate

**Every addition MUST pass ALL checks. Reject if ANY fails.**

1. **Executable** — Can Claude do this in a stateless session? Reject: mentoring, meetings, relationship-building, career development.
2. **Behavioral** — Does removing it change the agent's output? Reject: general knowledge a capable LLM already has.
3. **Non-redundant** — Already expressed elsewhere in the file? Reject duplicates even if worded differently.
4. **Concrete** — A specific action, check, or output format? Reject: aspirational fluff ("think holistically", "drive excellence"), decision matrices restating existing workflows.

---

## Evaluation Dimensions

Evaluate against ALL 8 dimensions. **Dimensions 1, 4, 6 propose additions — all must pass Content Gate.**

1. **Role Realism** — Behavior consistent with a senior practitioner, actionable by Claude in a stateless session?
2. **Actionability** — Specific enough for reliable execution? Clear workflows, concrete steps, defined outputs?
3. **Boundary Clarity** — Non-overlapping with other roles? "What You Are NOT" accurate? Handoff patterns defined?
4. **Completeness** — Gaps causing poor output? New Claude Code capabilities to leverage? Additions must pass Gate.
5. **Consolidation & Trimming (HIGHEST PRIORITY)** — Merge repeats, delete generic content, shorten verbose
   sections, remove LLM-innate knowledge. **Every addition from other dimensions MUST be offset here.**
6. **Capability Growth, Cross-Communication & Agent Teams** — New patterns improving output? No human career
   development. Evaluate proactive SendMessage triggers ("notify X when Y" / "consult X before Y") — flag
   definitions lacking them. Agent teams: shutdown handling, orchestrator lifecycle (TeamCreate → spawn →
   shutdown → TeamDelete), task coordination. Flag: missing cleanup, broadcast overuse. Also check:
   self-verification, course-correction triggers, efficient context management (targeted Grep over broad reads).
7. **Spec Alignment** — Alignment with `docs/spec/` project patterns and conventions?
8. **Rename Consideration** — Only if compelling — stability has value.

---

## Changelog Format

All changes tracked in `docs/changelog/agents/<agent-name>.md` (create directory if needed).

**Exact format — no deviations:** `# Changelog: <agent-name>` (kebab-case) > `## YYYY-MM-DD` (no suffixes) > exactly 4 H3 sections in order: `### Summary` (1-2 sentences), `### Changes` (bulleted with reasoning), `### Dimensions Evaluated`, `### Rename` (details or "No rename.").

**Rules:** Max 20 lines per entry. Prepend new entries (most recent first). Read only the latest entry in existing changelogs. Report honestly if no improvements found. After applying changes, the orchestrator normalizes: fixes H1, strips H2 suffixes, renames non-standard H3s, deletes extra sections, truncates over 20 lines.

---

## Orchestration Workflow

### Team Setup

Before spawning any agents, create an Agent Team to coordinate the evolution cycle:

1. **Create the team** — `TeamCreate(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}", ...)`
2. **Create Phase 0 tasks** — `TaskCreate(subject="Docs Research", description="Research latest Claude Code documentation for new capabilities")` and `TaskCreate(subject="Docket CLI Audit", description="Audit docket CLI for new/changed commands relevant to agents")`
3. **Create Phase 1 tasks** — one per target agent
4. **Create Phase 2 task** — Coherence & Renames (sequenced after all Phase 1 by orchestrator)

### Phase 0: Documentation Research & Docket CLI Audit

Spawn TWO teammates in parallel — a `claude-code-guide` for docs research and a `senior-engineer`
for docket CLI audit (needs Bash access):

```
Agent(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}", name="docs-researcher", subagent_type="claude-code-guide", prompt="...")
Agent(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}", name="docket-auditor", subagent_type="senior-engineer", prompt="...")
```

Assign Phase 0 tasks via `TaskUpdate`. After both complete, capture outputs as
`{docs_research_findings}` and `{docket_audit_findings}` — both are passed to Phase 1 agents.

Wait for both Phase 0 agents to complete before starting Phase 1.

### Phase 1: Review & Improve (parallel)

Spawn one teammate per target, using the **matching agent type** (e.g., spawn @senior-engineer to
review `.claude/agents/senior-engineer.md`). **Spawn all teammates in the same turn** to maximize
parallelism. If targeting a single agent, spawn one.

Spawn each as `Agent(name="review-<name>", subagent_type="<name>", team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}")` and assign the corresponding task via `TaskUpdate`.

Each self-reviewing teammate (read-only) follows the Phase 1 spawning template: reads its own
agent file, recent changelog, relevant specs, other agents' first ~80 lines, evaluates all 8
dimensions (prioritizing dimension 5), then reports structured recommendations. Use ultrathink
for deep analysis.

**After each Phase 1 teammate completes**, the orchestrator:

1. Reviews the teammate's change recommendations **against the Content Gate** — reject any
   addition that fails any gate check, even if the agent provides a rationale
2. Applies each approved change to `.claude/agents/<name>.md` using the Edit tool
3. Writes/updates the changelog entry in `docs/changelog/agents/<name>.md`
4. **Normalizes the changelog** per the Changelog Format rules above
5. Tracks rename recommendations and coherence issues for Phase 2
6. **Log cross-communication**: record any SendMessage exchanges between agents (sender, recipient, topic) for the wrap-up observability report
7. **Verify edits**: run `wc -l` for budget compliance, validate frontmatter intact and sections
   in order, check for broken cross-references to other agents/skills/specs.

Use `TaskList()` to check overall Phase 1 progress.

**If a Phase 1 agent reports cross-cutting findings via SendMessage**, route them to other
in-flight Phase 1 agents and aggregate for Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Coherence & Renames (sequential)

After ALL Phase 1 teammates complete and the orchestrator has applied their changes, spawn a
single @staff-engineer teammate (read-only) to review coherence and recommend fixes.

Spawn as `Agent(name="coherence-reviewer", subagent_type="staff-engineer", team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}")` and assign the Phase 2 task.

The Phase 2 teammate follows the Phase 2 spawning template: reads all agent files, verifies
renames, checks cross-agent coherence (boundaries, references, gaps, overlaps, terminology,
handoffs), then reports structured recommendations.

**After the Phase 2 teammate completes**, the orchestrator:

1. Executes any renames (`mv`, frontmatter updates, reference updates across codebase)
2. Applies coherence fixes using the Edit tool
3. Updates `docs/changelog/agents/<name>.md` for any agent that received coherence fixes

### Wrap-up & Team Cleanup

After Phase 2: shut down all teammates via `SendMessage(shutdown_request)`, then
`TeamDelete(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}")`. Run `wc -l` on all targets —
consolidate any over 500. Report: files modified, before/after line counts, improvements,
renames/coherence fixes, and reminder that NO changes have been committed.

**Observability report** (always include): cross-communication events (which agents messaged
which, and why), vote skill invocations (proposals, outcomes), and course-corrections surfaced.

## Spawning Templates

### Phase 0: @claude-code-guide (Documentation Research)

```
Agent(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}", name="docs-researcher", subagent_type="claude-code-guide", prompt="...")

MISSION: Research Claude Code documentation for capabilities relevant to writing agent definition files (.claude/agents/*.md). Report NEW or CHANGED features only — skip well-known existing behavior.

TIER 1 — MUST research (visit every page, extract all relevant capabilities):
- Sub-agents — agent types, frontmatter fields (name, description, tools, model, allowed-tools), capability control, tool restrictions, MCP scoping, permission modes, spawning patterns, persistent memory, hooks for subagents, auto-delegation
- Agent Teams — team setup, teammate config, plan approval, task assignment, team communication (SendMessage), shutdown/cleanup protocol, quality gates, team architecture, permissions, token usage
- Hooks Reference — all hook event types (SubagentStart, SubagentStop, TeammateIdle, TaskCompleted, Stop), matcher patterns (including MCP tools), handler types (command, HTTP, prompt, agent), input/output schemas, async hooks
- Skills — skill-agent interaction, skill preloading in subagents, tool restriction patterns
- Permissions — permission modes, permission rule syntax, tool-specific rules (Bash, Read/Edit, WebFetch, MCP, Agent), managed permissions

TIER 2 — SHOULD research (visit each page, extract agent-relevant changes):
- Settings — configuration scopes, settings files, subagent configuration, plugin config, environment variables
- MCP — MCP server patterns, tool search, managed configuration, MCP scoping for agents
- Tools Reference — available tools, tool behavior details relevant to agent definitions
- Memory — auto-memory system, CLAUDE.md files, memory in subagents
- Best Practices — verification methods, communication patterns, subagent usage, context management
- Plugins Reference — plugin components including agents, plugin manifest

TIER 3 — SCAN for changes (quick scan, report only new/changed features):
- Commands, How Claude Code Works, Changelog, CLI Reference, Output Styles, Keybindings

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Tier 1: Visit EVERY page, extract new/changed/deprecated features. Filter question: "Would this change how an agent definition file should be written?"
- If a page fails to load, note it and continue. Report which pages were researched vs skipped.

OUTPUT FORMAT: `- **<capability/change>**: <agent definition relevance>` grouped under: New Capabilities, Changed Features, Deprecated/Removed, Recommendations.
```

### Phase 0: Docket CLI Audit

Spawn one docket-auditor agent using `subagent_type: "senior-engineer"` (needs Bash access).

```
Agent(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}", name="docket-auditor", subagent_type="senior-engineer", prompt="...")

You are auditing the docket CLI to produce a structured reference for agent evolution reviewers.

## Steps

1. Run `--help` on every docket command and subcommand (top-level, `issue`, `vote`, all leaf commands) to capture flags and usage.
2. Grep for `docket ` across `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/` to find current usage.
3. Cross-reference: identify new/changed/deprecated commands vs. codebase usage. Specifically check for: `docket vote commit`, `docket plan`, `docket next`, `docket board`, `--findings-json`, `--summary`, `--rationale`, `--domain-tags`, `--files-changed`, `--escalation-reason`, `approve-with-concerns` verdict

## Output
Report New, Changed, and Deprecated commands (with synopsis/context) plus a full CLI reference tree with flags for each leaf command.

## Rules
- DO NOT edit any files. Read-only — audit and report only.
- Be thorough — run --help on every subcommand, not just the common ones.
- If a command errors on --help, note it as unavailable.
```

### Phase 1: Self-Review & Improve

Spawn one teammate per target using `team_name`, `name`, and `subagent_type` matching the agent
name (e.g., `subagent_type: "senior-engineer"` for `.claude/agents/senior-engineer.md`). Substitute
`<name>`, `{today_date}` (from pre-flight step 3), `{verified_goal}` (from step 1), and `{experience_feedback}` (from step 2) for each.

```
Agent(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}", name="review-<name>", subagent_type="<name>", prompt="...")

Read .claude/agents/<name>.md — this is YOUR definition. You are reviewing yourself to evolve.

Target: .claude/agents/<name>.md | Size: {line_count} lines | Mode: {mode}
Verified goal: {verified_goal} (pre-verified — re-verify if your understanding diverges)
Experience feedback: {experience_feedback}

## Size Budget

500-line hard limit. **TRIM** (over 500): consolidation primary — removals must exceed additions.
**BALANCED** (under 500): additions allowed but offset by removals. Report NET_LINES per change.

## Context

- Date: {today_date} (for changelog). Read latest changelog entry from docs/changelog/agents/<name>.md.
- Read docs/spec/ selectively, other agent files first ~80 lines only. Skip WebFetch.
- Review operator experience feedback below — prioritize addressing reported pain points and friction.
- Review docs/Claude Code research and docket audit findings below — reflect new capabilities
  and verify docket commands/flags are current.

## Claude Code Documentation Research
{docs_research_findings}

## Docket CLI Audit Findings
{docket_audit_findings}

## Operator Experience Feedback
{experience_feedback}

## Content Gate (ALL additions must pass — reject if ANY fails)

Apply 4-check gate (Executable, Behavioral, Non-redundant, Concrete) — reject additions failing ANY check.

## Task: Evaluate ALL 8 dimensions

1. **Role Realism**: Senior practitioner behavior, actionable by Claude?
2. **Actionability**: Specific workflows, concrete steps, defined outputs?
3. **Boundary Clarity**: Non-overlapping roles, accurate "What You Are NOT", handoff patterns?
4. **Completeness**: Gaps or new capabilities to leverage?
5. **Consolidation & Trimming (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**: Remove, shorten, merge. Every addition offset here.
6. **Capability Growth & Cross-Communication**: New patterns? Proactive SendMessage triggers ("notify X
   when Y")? Agent team patterns (shutdown, lifecycle, task coordination)? Flag gaps.
7. **Spec Alignment**: Aligned with docs/spec/?
8. **Rename**: Only if compelling.

## Rules

- **Read-only** — analyze and recommend, do not edit files. Build on strengths, don't rewrite.
- **Minimize context**: first 80 lines of other agents, relevant specs only.
- **Course-correct**: SendMessage orchestrator immediately for cross-cutting issues, universal patterns,
  or scope expansion beyond target agent.
- **Avoid anti-patterns**: infinite exploration, kitchen-sink reviewing, over-correction loops.

## Output Format

`### Summary` (1-2 sentences + net line change) > `### Recommended Changes` (per change:
CHANGE/DIMENSION/CONTEXT/NET_LINES/OLD_STRING/NEW_STRING — use `<REMOVE>` to delete,
`<INSERT_AFTER>` to add) > `### Changelog Entry` (under 20 lines, 4 sections: Summary, Changes,
Dimensions Evaluated, Rename) > `### Rename Recommendation` > `### Coherence Issues`
```

### Phase 2: @staff-engineer (Coherence & Renames)

Read-only cross-cutting coherence review. Orchestrator applies all edits. Substitute `{today_date}`.

```
Agent(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}", name="coherence-reviewer", subagent_type="staff-engineer", prompt="...")

Check cross-agent coherence and recommend fixes. Date: {today_date}. **Read-only — do not edit files.**

## Renames to Execute
<list recommended renames, or "No renames were recommended.">

## Phase 1 Coherence Issues
<list issues from Phase 1, or "None reported.">

## Task

1. Read ALL agent files in .claude/agents/*.md
2. If renames listed, verify and prepare rename instructions (file, frontmatter, references, changelog)
3. Check coherence: "What You Are NOT" accuracy, bidirectional cross-references, no gaps/overlaps,
   consistent terminology, handoff patterns work both ways
4. Check cross-communication: enumerate SendMessage trigger pairs, identify missing triggers between
   dependent agents, flag hub-and-spoke patterns (>50% through one agent), verify bidirectionality

## Output

`### Renames` (RENAME/FRONTMATTER_UPDATE/REFERENCES_TO_UPDATE/CHANGELOG_RENAME or "No renames needed")
> `### Coherence Fixes` (FIX/FILE/OLD_STRING/NEW_STRING/REASON or "No issues found") >
`### Changelog Entries` (4 sections, max 20 lines per agent) > `### Remaining Issues`
```

---

## Rules

1. **Pre-flight before spawning.** Validate files exist and arguments resolve.
2. **TeamCreate → TaskCreate before any Agent calls.** Phase 0 → Phase 1 (parallel) → Phase 2.
3. **Always run Phase 2** — even for single-agent improvements.
4. **Orchestrator-only edits.** Teammates are read-only. Never commit.
5. **Enforce Content Gate, 500-line budget, and changelog format** per their sections above.
6. **Build on strengths** — improve, don't rewrite.
7. **Fail loud.** Report failures immediately.
8. **Timeout fallback.** Re-spawn once; after two failures, orchestrator reviews directly.
9. **Content Gate enforced.** Reject additions failing any check — primary bloat defense.
10. **500-line budget.** `wc -l` after edits; consolidate if over.
11. **Clean up.** Shutdown all teammates and `TeamDelete` after wrap-up.
