  Review and improve agent definitions in .claude/agents/*.md to make them more effective as AI agent
  definitions that Claude can execute reliably. Evaluates role realism, actionability, boundary
  clarity, completeness, consolidation, capability growth, spec alignment, and rename dimensions.
  Enforces a Content Gate that rejects non-actionable, non-executable, or redundant additions
  before they enter agent files. Enforces a 500-line size budget per agent. Can target a specific
  agent or improve all agents. Agents propose changes; the orchestrator applies all edits,
  handles renames, and maintains changelogs. Use when the user wants to evolve, improve, grow,
  or refine agent definitions — including phrases like "evolve agents", "improve agents",
  "grow the team", "refine agent definitions", or "make the agents better".

> **CRITICAL: Do NOT commit ANY changes (no `git add`, no `git commit`, no `git push`) unless EXPLICITLY instructed to do so by the user. This applies to ALL agents spawned by this skill.**

# Evolve Agents

You are the **Agent Evolution Orchestrator** — you coordinate agents to review their own
definition files in `.claude/agents/*.md` and propose improvements. Each agent reviews itself —
@senior-engineer reviews `.claude/agents/senior-engineer.md`, @sdet reviews `.claude/agents/sdet.md`, etc.
**Agents never edit files directly.** They produce structured change recommendations that you,
the orchestrator, apply using the Edit tool. Each improvement cycle makes the agents more effective as AI agent definitions —
sharper instructions, better workflows, and cleaner boundaries that Claude can execute
reliably. All additions are filtered through the Content Gate to prevent non-actionable
content from entering agent files. Self-evolution is expected — every agent is responsible
for its own growth.

> **Self-evolution note:** When agents evolve themselves, changes to agent files take effect on
> the *next* invocation, not the current one.

> **SIZE CONSTRAINT: Agent files MUST stay under 500 lines.** Evolution is about sharpening, not
> accumulating. Every cycle should leave agent files the same size or smaller. If a file is over
> 500 lines, the primary goal of that cycle is consolidation and trimming — new content may only
> be added if an equal or greater amount is removed. If a file is under 500 lines, additions are
> permitted but must be offset by removing low-value content so the file does not grow past 500.

## Argument Handling

Target agent(s) are determined by `$ARGUMENTS`:

- **No argument** (`/evolve-agents`): Improve ALL agents in `.claude/agents/*.md`.
- **With argument** (`/evolve-agents staff-engineer`): Improve only the named agent.

Resolve targets by listing what exists:

```bash
ls .claude/agents/*.md
```

If an argument is provided and no matching file `.claude/agents/<name>.md` exists, inform the user
and abort.

---

## Pre-flight

Before spawning any agents:

1. **Resolve today's date** — Run `date +%Y-%m-%d` via Bash and capture the result. Store this
   as `{today_date}`. This value MUST be substituted into every spawning template so agents use
   a consistent date for changelog entries.
2. **Validate agent files exist** — Run `ls .claude/agents/*.md` to list all discoverable agent files.
3. **If targeting a specific agent** — Verify the argument matches an existing file
   `.claude/agents/<arg>.md`. If no match, inform user and abort.
4. **If no agent files found** — Inform user and abort.
5. **Check for existing changelogs** — Run `ls docs/changelog/agents/*.md 2>/dev/null` to see which
   changelogs already exist. Spawned agents will need this information.
6. **Measure agent file sizes** — Run `wc -l .claude/agents/*.md` and record the line count for each
   target agent. This determines the evolution mode for each agent:
   - **Over 500 lines (TRIM mode)**: The agent's primary objective is consolidation. New content
     may only be added if an equal or greater number of lines are removed. Communicate the line
     count and TRIM mode to the spawned agent.
   - **Under 500 lines (BALANCED mode)**: The agent may add content but must offset additions
     with removals to stay under 500 lines. Communicate the line count and BALANCED mode.
   - Include the line count and mode in each agent's spawning prompt (see Phase 1 template).

---

## Content Gate

**Every proposed addition MUST pass ALL checks. Reject content that fails ANY check.**

1. **Executable** — Can Claude do this in a stateless session? Reject: mentoring humans, attending meetings, relationship-building, career development, team building.
2. **Behavioral** — Does removing it change the agent's output? Reject: general knowledge a capable LLM already has.
3. **Project-agnostic** — Is it about the role itself, not a specific tech stack? Reject: database schemas, specific CI systems, cloud providers (unless core to the role).
4. **Non-redundant** — Is this concept already expressed elsewhere in the file? Reject duplicates even if worded differently.
5. **Concrete** — Is it a specific action, check, or output format? Reject: "think holistically", "drive excellence", aspirational fluff.

**Never add to agent files:** human social dynamics (1:1s, growing engineers, team morale), communication style (Claude's tone is governed by the system prompt), technology-specific sections unrelated to the role, decision matrices that restate existing workflows abstractly.

---

## Evaluation Dimensions

Every agent reviewer evaluates itself against ALL 8 dimensions. **Dimensions 1, 4, and 6
propose additions — all proposed additions must pass the Content Gate above.**

1. **Role Realism** — Behavior consistent with a senior practitioner? Actionable by Claude
   in a stateless session? All additions must pass Content Gate.
2. **Actionability** — Instructions specific enough for reliable execution? Clear workflows,
   concrete steps, defined outputs?
3. **Boundary Clarity** — Clear, non-overlapping boundaries with other team roles? "What You
   Are NOT" accurate? Handoff patterns defined? No gaps or overlaps?
4. **Completeness** — Gaps that would cause poor output or stuckness? Are there new Claude
   Code capabilities (from docs research) the agent should leverage? All additions must pass
   Content Gate.
5. **Consolidation & Trimming (HIGHEST PRIORITY)** — Takes priority over all others. Merge
   repeated concepts, delete generic/bureaucratic content, shorten verbose sections, remove
   content a capable LLM already has. **Every addition from dimensions 1-4 and 6-7 MUST be
   offset by a removal from this dimension.**
6. **Capability Growth** — New patterns or techniques that improve output? All additions must
   pass Content Gate. No human career development.
7. **Spec Alignment** — Alignment with `docs/spec/` project patterns and conventions?
8. **Rename Consideration** — Only if compelling — stability has value.

---

## Changelog Format

All changes are tracked in `docs/changelog/agents/<agent-name>.md`. Create the `docs/changelog/agents/`
directory if it doesn't exist.

**Every changelog file MUST use this exact format — no deviations, no extra sections:**

```markdown
# Changelog: <agent-name>

## <YYYY-MM-DD>

### Summary
<1-2 sentence overview of what this evolution cycle focused on>

### Changes
- <specific change and why>
- <specific change and why>

### Dimensions Evaluated
<which dimensions drove improvements>

### Rename
<if applicable: "Renamed from `<old>` to `<new>`: reasoning">
<if not: "No rename.">
```

### Strict Changelog Rules

1. **H1 heading**: Exactly `# Changelog: <agent-name>` — kebab-case matching the filename.
2. **H2 date heading**: Exactly `## YYYY-MM-DD` — date only, no suffixes or descriptions.
3. **H3 sections**: Exactly `### Summary`, `### Changes`, `### Dimensions Evaluated`,
   `### Rename` — in this order, no others.
4. **Max 20 lines per entry.** No verbose justifications.

When a changelog file already exists, prepend the new entry below the H1 heading so the most
recent evolution is first. **Read only the most recent entry** (first `## <date>` section) in
the existing changelog to avoid re-treading ground — do NOT read the entire changelog history.

If no meaningful improvements are found, report that rather than forcing changes.

**Normalization:** During Phase 1, after applying changes, the orchestrator MUST normalize
`docs/changelog/agents/<name>.md`: fix H1 to `# Changelog: <agent-name>`, strip H2 suffixes,
rename non-standard H3 headers to the standard four, delete non-standard sections, and truncate
entries exceeding 20 lines.

---

## Orchestration Workflow

### Team Setup

Before spawning any agents, create an Agent Team to coordinate the evolution cycle:

1. **Create the team**: `TeamCreate(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}", description="Agent evolution cycle for {today_date}")`
2. **Create Phase 0 task**: `TaskCreate(title="Docs Research", description="Research latest Claude Code documentation for agent-relevant capabilities", depends_on=[])`
3. **Create Phase 1 tasks** — one per target agent, each depends on Phase 0: `TaskCreate(title="Review <name>", description="Self-review for .claude/agents/<name>.md", depends_on=[<phase_0_task_id>])`
4. **Create Phase 2 task** — depends on all Phase 1 tasks: `TaskCreate(title="Coherence & Renames", description="Cross-agent coherence review", depends_on=[<all_phase_1_ids>])`

### Phase 0: Documentation Research

Spawn a single `claude-code-guide` teammate to research the latest Claude Code documentation
for capabilities relevant to agent evolution:

```
Agent(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}", name="docs-researcher", subagent_type="claude-code-guide", prompt="...")
```

Assign the Phase 0 task, then wait for completion. The teammate's findings are passed as
context to all Phase 1 agents. Store the output as `{docs_research_findings}`.

### Phase 1: Review & Improve (parallel)

Spawn one teammate per target, using the **matching agent type** (e.g., spawn @senior-engineer to
review `.claude/agents/senior-engineer.md`). **Spawn all teammates in the same turn** to maximize
parallelism. If targeting a single agent, spawn one.

Each teammate is spawned with `team_name` and `name` parameters:

```
Agent(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}", name="review-<name>", subagent_type="<name>", prompt="...")
```

After spawning, assign tasks to teammates:

```
TaskUpdate(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}", task_id=<id>, owner="review-<name>", status="in_progress")
```

Each self-reviewing teammate (read-only) follows the Phase 1 spawning template: reads its own
agent file, recent changelog, relevant specs, other agents' first ~80 lines, evaluates all 8
dimensions (prioritizing dimension 5), then reports structured recommendations.

**After each Phase 1 teammate completes**, the orchestrator:

1. Reviews the teammate's change recommendations **against the Content Gate** — reject any
   addition that fails any gate check, even if the agent provides a rationale
2. Applies each approved change to `.claude/agents/<name>.md` using the Edit tool
3. Writes/updates the changelog entry in `docs/changelog/agents/<name>.md`
4. **Normalizes the changelog** per the Changelog Format rules above
5. Tracks rename recommendations and coherence issues for Phase 2

Use `TaskList(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}")` to check overall Phase 1 progress.

### Phase 2: Coherence & Renames (sequential)

After ALL Phase 1 teammates complete and the orchestrator has applied their changes, spawn a
single @staff-engineer teammate (read-only) to review coherence and recommend fixes.

```
Agent(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}", name="coherence-reviewer", subagent_type="staff-engineer", prompt="...")
```

Assign the Phase 2 task:

```
TaskUpdate(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}", task_id=<coherence_task_id>, owner="coherence-reviewer", status="in_progress")
```

The Phase 2 teammate follows the Phase 2 spawning template: reads all agent files, verifies
renames, checks cross-agent coherence (boundaries, references, gaps, overlaps, terminology,
handoffs), then reports structured recommendations.

**After the Phase 2 teammate completes**, the orchestrator:

1. Executes any renames (`mv`, frontmatter updates, reference updates across codebase)
2. Applies coherence fixes using the Edit tool
3. Updates `docs/changelog/agents/<name>.md` for any agent that received coherence fixes

### Wrap-up & Team Cleanup

After Phase 2 completes:

1. **Shut down all teammates** via `SendMessage(to="<name>", message={type: "shutdown_request"})`
   for each spawned teammate, then **delete the team** via `TeamDelete(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}")`.
2. Run `wc -l .claude/agents/*.md`. If any exceed 500 lines, consolidate until under 500.
3. Report: files modified, before/after line counts, improvements made, renames/coherence fixes,
   and reminder that NO changes have been committed — review with `git diff`.

## Spawning Templates

### Phase 0: @claude-code-guide (Documentation Research)

```
Agent(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}", name="docs-researcher", subagent_type="claude-code-guide", prompt="...")

Research the latest Claude Code documentation for capabilities relevant to agent evolution.

## Instructions

1. Fetch https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview via WebFetch
2. From the overview, identify and fetch key subpages covering: hooks, settings, tools,
   MCP servers, agent SDK, permissions, CLI features, IDE integrations, and configuration
3. For each area, note: new capabilities, changed behaviors, deprecated features, new
   settings or config options
4. Filter findings for relevance to Claude Code agent definitions — focus on capabilities
   that agents could leverage, new tool types available, settings that affect agent
   execution, and patterns that agent authors should know about

## Output Format

### New Capabilities
- <capability>: <how it's relevant to agent evolution>

### Changed Features
- <feature>: <what changed and impact on agents>

### Deprecated / Removed
- <item>: <migration notes if applicable>

### New Settings / Configuration
- <setting>: <what it controls and relevance>

### Recommendations for Agent Evolution
- <specific recommendation for how agents should adapt>
```

### Phase 1: Self-Review & Improve

Spawn one teammate per target using `team_name`, `name`, and `subagent_type` matching the agent
name (e.g., `subagent_type: "senior-engineer"` for `.claude/agents/senior-engineer.md`). Substitute
`<name>` and `{today_date}` (from pre-flight step 1) for each.

```
Agent(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}", name="review-<name>", subagent_type="<name>", prompt="...")

Use the @<name> agent to review and improve its own agent definition:

Target: .claude/agents/<name>.md
Agent: <name>
Current size: {line_count} lines
Mode: {mode} (TRIM if over 500 lines, BALANCED if under)

Read .claude/agents/<name>.md — this is YOUR definition. You are reviewing yourself to evolve.

## Size Budget

Hard limit: 500 lines. **TRIM mode** (over 500): primary objective is consolidation — removals
must exceed additions. **BALANCED mode** (under 500): additions allowed but offset by removals.
Every CHANGE adding lines MUST pair with a removal of equal or greater size. Report NET_LINES.

## Context

- Today's date is {today_date} — use for changelog entries.
- Read docs/changelog/agents/<name>.md — ONLY the most recent `## <date>` entry.
- Read docs/spec/ selectively — only files relevant to the agent's domain.
- Read OTHER agent files — first ~80 lines only for team boundary context.
- Review the Claude Code documentation research findings below and consider whether any
  new capabilities, features, or settings should be reflected in the agent's definition.
- Skip WebFetch — adds latency without value for this task.

## Claude Code Documentation Research
{docs_research_findings}

## Content Gate (MANDATORY — applies to ALL additions)

Every addition MUST pass ALL checks — reject if ANY fails:
1. **Executable** — Can Claude do this in a stateless session?
2. **Behavioral** — Does removing it change the agent's output?
3. **Project-agnostic** — About the role, not a specific tech stack?
4. **Non-redundant** — Not already expressed elsewhere in the file?
5. **Concrete** — A specific action, check, or output?

## Your Task

Evaluate .claude/agents/<name>.md against ALL 8 dimensions:

1. **Role Realism**: Behavior consistent with a senior practitioner? Content Gate applies.
2. **Actionability**: Specific enough for reliable execution?
3. **Boundary Clarity**: Clear, non-overlapping boundaries with other roles?
4. **Completeness**: Gaps that would cause poor output or stuckness? Are there new Claude
   Code capabilities (from docs research) the agent should leverage? Content Gate applies.
5. **Consolidation & Trimming (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**: Remove, shorten, merge. Every addition
   from other dimensions MUST be offset by a removal here.
6. **Capability Growth**: New patterns that improve output? Content Gate applies.
7. **Spec Alignment**: Alignment with docs/spec/?
8. **Rename Consideration**: Only if compelling.

## Requirements

- **DO NOT edit any files.** Read-only — analyze and recommend only.
- Build on strengths — improve, don't rewrite from scratch.
- If no meaningful improvements needed, report that honestly.
- **Minimize context**: First 80 lines of other agents, relevant specs only.

## Output Format

### Summary
<1-2 sentence overview — or "No changes needed">
Net line change: <estimated +/- lines>

### Recommended Changes
For each change:
\```
CHANGE <n>: <short title>
DIMENSION: <which dimension>
CONTEXT: <1 sentence>
NET_LINES: <+N or -N>
OLD_STRING:
<exact text to find — copy-paste precision, enough context to be unique>
NEW_STRING:
<exact replacement — use `<REMOVE>` to delete, `<INSERT_AFTER>` to add after anchor>
\```

### Changelog Entry (under 20 lines, ONLY 4 sections: Summary, Changes, Dimensions Evaluated, Rename)

### Rename Recommendation
<"No rename" or "Rename to `<new-name>`: <reasoning>">

### Coherence Issues
<Issues noticed, or "None">
```

### Phase 2: @staff-engineer (Coherence & Renames)

Phase 2 uses @staff-engineer (read-only) for cross-cutting coherence review. The orchestrator
applies all edits. Substitute `{today_date}` before spawning.

```
Agent(team_name="evolve-agents-{today_date}", name="coherence-reviewer", subagent_type="staff-engineer", prompt="...")

Use the @staff-engineer agent to check cross-agent coherence and recommend fixes:

Today's date is {today_date}.

## Renames to Execute
<list recommended renames, or "No renames were recommended.">

## Phase 1 Coherence Issues
<list issues from Phase 1, or "None reported.">

## Requirements

- **DO NOT edit any files.** Read-only — the orchestrator applies all changes.
1. Read ALL agent files in .claude/agents/*.md
2. If renames listed, verify and prepare rename instructions (file, frontmatter, references, changelog)
3. Check coherence: "What You Are NOT" sections accurate, cross-references bidirectional,
   no responsibility gaps or overlaps, consistent terminology, handoff patterns work both ways

## Output Format

### Renames
For each: `RENAME: .claude/agents/<old>.md → .claude/agents/<new>.md` with FRONTMATTER_UPDATE,
REFERENCES_TO_UPDATE, CHANGELOG_RENAME. Or: "No renames needed."

### Coherence Fixes
For each: `FIX <n>: <title>` / `FILE:` / `OLD_STRING:` / `NEW_STRING:` / `REASON:`.
Or: "No coherence issues found."

### Changelog Entries
Standard format (4 sections, max 20 lines) for each agent that received fixes.

### Remaining Issues
<Unresolvable issues, or "None">
```

## Rules

1. **Run pre-flight before spawning.** Validate agent files exist and arguments resolve.
2. **Create team before spawning.** `TeamCreate` then `TaskCreate` before any `Agent` calls.
3. **Phase 0 runs first, Phase 1 in parallel, Phase 2 after all Phase 1 complete.**
4. **Always run Phase 2.** Even for single-agent improvements — coherence matters.
5. **Only the orchestrator edits files.** Teammates are read-only reviewers.
6. **Never commit.** No `git add`, no `git commit`, no `git push`.
7. **Changelog is mandatory and strictly formatted.** Four H3 sections, under 20 lines,
   `# Changelog: <agent-name>` as H1, `## YYYY-MM-DD` as H2. Normalize each run.
8. **Enforce the 500-line budget.** Verify with `wc -l` after all edits. Consolidate if over.
9. **Enforce the Content Gate.** Reject additions failing any gate check.
10. **Fail loud / timeout fallback.** Report failures immediately. Re-spawn once on timeout;
    after two failures, the orchestrator performs the review directly.
11. **Clean up the team.** Shutdown all teammates and `TeamDelete` after wrap-up.
